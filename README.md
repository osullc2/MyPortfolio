## Colin O'Sullivan — Portfolio

This is a simple, fast, and easily editable personal portfolio built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Structure
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles/` — stylesheets (primary file: `main.css`)
- `scripts/` — JavaScript (primary file: `main.js`)
- `Images/` — logos and project images (add your assets here)

### Local Development
Open `index.html` in your browser directly, or serve the directory with a simple static server.

### Updating Content
In later commits, sections like Skills, Experience, Projects, and Activities will be data-driven via `scripts/main.js` so you can add new items by editing arrays/objects instead of HTML.

### License
Personal use.
